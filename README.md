# Marine-Heatwaves

This repository includes the script used for the following study:

Colombi, N., Kropf, C.M., Burger, F.A., Bresch, D.N. and Fr√∂licher, T.L., 2024. Modelling marine heatwaves impact on shallow and upper mesophotic tropical coral reefs. Environmental Research Letters, 19(12), p.124053.

Due to the large size of the datasets, please contact me to access the data to reproduce the study, that is temperature data at the locations of coral reefs, or to access data on the model output, that is the bleaching percentage between 1993 and 2023 with daily resolution.
